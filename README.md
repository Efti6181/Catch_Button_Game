# Catch the Button Game

## Overview

The Catch the Button Game is an engaging and interactive application developed using Python's Tkinter library. This game challenges users with a random question, offering them the choice between "Yes" and "No" responses. The twist lies in the "No" button, which unpredictably moves around the screen when hovered over, adding an element of fun and difficulty.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter, providing a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Interactive Challenge**: Users are presented with a random question and must choose between "Yes" or "No."
- **Dynamic Button Movement**: The "No" button moves randomly when hovered over, increasing the challenge.
- **Playful Feedback**: Clicking "Yes" results in a playful message, concluding the game.
- **Time-Based Interaction**: The game ends if the user fails to interact within a specified time frame, resulting in a dare.

## Requirements

To run this game, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: The game is compatible with Python 3.x versions.
- **Tkinter Library**: Tkinter is typically included with Python installations.

## How It Works

1. **Game Start**: The game begins by posing a random question. You can customize the question by editing the source code.
2. **Button Interaction**: 
   - Hovering over the "No" button causes it to move to a random position, making it challenging to click.
   - Clicking the "Yes" button displays a customizable message and ends the game.
3. **Game End**: The game concludes either when the "Yes" button is clicked or if the user fails to interact within the allotted time, leading to a dare.

## Customization

- **Question**: Modify the random question by editing the relevant section in the code.
- **Message**: Customize the message displayed upon clicking "Yes" by altering the code.
